# **GPU2**

This is created since `GPU.sol` has reached the max size limit of the contracts. 
It is gonna help us accomodate more functonalities by interacting with `GPU.sol`.
The same format and order of contracts will be used. 
The the continuation of `AddValidator.sol` will now be found in `validator.sol`, 
`AddProvider` will be found in `provider.sol` and so on.
